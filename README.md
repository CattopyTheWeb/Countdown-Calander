# Countdown Calander
Count down to an event with this script
#
# Setup:
There are two ways you can set this up
1. Enter your events in the `events.txt` file in this format `Event-Name,31/12/23` make sure to enter only the last two digits of the year and only type the date in digits.

2. Run `event-adder.py` and follow the prompts and the events will be added automatically.
#
Once you added all your events run `countdown_calander.py` and see how many days are left until your events.
#

# Credits
The calander script was from a python book but the event adder is made by me.
